My name is __Sam__ and I am a __programming__ student at _Monash University_, Australia. I love tinkering with things - I am that curious fellow that enjoyed learning assembly language.

I believe that the ability to program is one of the most fundamentally _important skills_ of the twenty-first century. I believe that by programming we have and will continue to produce creations that can affect humanity beneficially on a massive scale.

My current research project, and _thesis_, is exploring whether low-cost computing and haptics/auditory systems can be used to facilitate and improve the learning experience of __blind programming students__.

If you'd like to have a chat about coding or anything the least bit faintly related, please do drop me a line.

<!-- Maybe we can write _beautiful code_ together? -->
