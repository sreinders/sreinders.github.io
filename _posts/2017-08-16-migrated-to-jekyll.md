Jekyll is a static website generator. It utilises Markdown to create deployable websites. Having heard about Jekyll months prior, I decided to take the opportunity to apply Jekyll to my personal website. The rationale behind this decision was based on the fact that Jekyll allows creators to focus on solely on content, rather than verbose feature sets in packages such as Wordpress et al.

The setup process was incredibly simple and the bundled development server allows the easy preview of added content. The flexible nature of Jekyll makes it very modular and it will be exciting pushing further updates and features to the site in the coming months.
